  ## Instructions
  The first thing you want to do is open up your intergrated terminal. Once you are in the correct file then you would proceed into typing 'node index.js' into the terminal. This will automatically process you through a series of commands that will ask the user questions such as 'What is the title of your project?' to help the user generate a README. Once the user has finished with these series of commands then the console will automatically say 'README.md file generated successfully!'. Once ther README has been generated successfully then the generated README will pop up in the Develop folder as 'readme.md'.

  ## motivation
  The reason or the motivation for this generator was for upcoming challenges and future projects. Creating this README generator makes more time for me as a user to work and focus more on the project than stressing about the README.
